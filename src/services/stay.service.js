Close to the action but on a quiet street, down the road from an outstanding Indian restaurant, 5 minute walk from South Kensington station and from the V&A and Natural History museums. The kitchen/sitting room is up a narrow staircase though, so keep in mind if that may pose a challenge. Overall was a great location for our London vacation and would definitely consider booking again.',
